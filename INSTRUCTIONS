How to build bitplanes:

---

On Ubuntu:
./get_libs.sh

^ This will get (most) of the required libs and programs
If you don't use apt-get on your system you can do something like
sudo PACKAGE_MANAGER install `cat third_party/lib_names.txt`

You'll also need to obtain and build Allegro5 yourself (not included).
There's instructions for that on the web.

Now run:
./build.sh

If the build succeeds, you can run the game by typing:
./run.sh
(or navigating to bin/ and running ./bitplanes)

---

Other Platforms:
Grab the packages listed in third_party/lib_names.txt for your
platform, as well as Allegro5.

Run:
cd build
cmake ..

On windows, there is a cmake GUI utility
