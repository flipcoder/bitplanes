How to build bitplanes:

For Ubuntu, run:
    ./get_libs.sh

^ This will get (most) of the required libs and programs
If you don't use apt-get on your system you can do something like
sudo PACKAGE_MANAGER install `cat third_party/lib_names.txt`

You'll also need to obtain and build Allegro5 yourself (not included).
Make sure to run "sudo ldconfig" after installing Allegro
There's instructions for that on the web.

Now download premake4 for your platform from http://industriousone.com/premake/download

Now run (for Linux):
    ./build.sh

OR: run premake4 with the correct parameters for your operating system,
    See: http://industriousone.com/premake-quick-start
    after that, run the makefile that will be generated in the build/ folder
    By running "make" inside the build folder

If the build succeeds, everything needed will appear in the bin folder :)
