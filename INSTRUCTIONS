How to build bitplanes:

For Ubuntu, run:
    chmod +x get_libs.sh && ./get_libs.sh

^ This will get (most) of the required libs and programs
If you don't use apt-get on your system you can do something like
sudo PACKAGE_MANAGER install `cat third_party/lib_names.txt`

You'll also need to obtain and build Allegro5 yourself (not included).
Make sure to run "sudo ldconfig" after installing Allegro
There's instructions for that on the web.

Now run:
    make

The included Windows MSVC2010 project files are a work-in-progress so may not work correctly.

If the build succeeds, everything needed will appear in the bin folder :)
